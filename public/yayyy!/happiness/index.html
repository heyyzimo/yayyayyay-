    <h2 class = "centered">what am i doing at 23 year old</h2>

    <h3>why im making this webwebweb!</h3>
<p>
    I am in my second year of gradute school and i just turned 23 this summer. boston has been a romantic place. so far, so good. As a trilingual person, i have been to around 40 countries aross different 5 continents. there were so many crazy and happy memories, but also some traumatic ones. i want to write everything down about my young life.. and read it when i am 70 hahaha also i feel im being "adultilized" step by step.. idk if i will still be pure, kind and naive in the future.. i feel i wont do bad things, but i will probably stop telling everyone everthing or even stop being honest.. i have always wanted to save the environment because I love nature and am passionate about conservation. I also have wanted help peopdle since i was little bc it makes me feel useful and good.. but in this adult world, money is everything. idk what i want to do or should do in the future. i am actually scared of looking for jobs as an international student.. im scared of seeing a lot of people lying and pretending.. stop i never complain, and i should always see the good side of life!! here is a real me,CHEER UP!!! every time i think about my childhood life studying 15 hours a day and being 100% loyal to those ancient poems telling me what kind of person i should be. persistent, upright, courageous, resilient, loyal, steadfast, do good and right things, i will probably feel regret about the person I am in the future, so I will correct myself in time...

<h3>happy happy my likes</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Boxing, i really like Mitts class, and this is probably the only sport im really good at; </li>
    <li>yoga, i have been practicing for 5 years but still look like a beginner even tho im a certified yoga instructor ahahaha i never taught yoga bc i always feel im not good enough, which is probably also the fact</li>
   <li>triple chocolate ice cream, spicy fried chicken, pistachio gelato,fresh egg fettuccine, bbq, crawfish, cheese topping tea, rodda clotted cream, pulpo, bocadillo de jamon y queso</li>
   <li>tennis,.,this makes me feel self-abasement, im probably not good at any sport but still need to workout bc i eat too much...i took about 30 classes, and uploaded the video online, and got a lot of bad comments...</li>
   <li>latte art; i really enjoy pouring a heart on the top of my latte every morning. i still drink the coffee even tho i dont like coffee much ahahhah</li>
   <li>travel? now i prefer a settle-down life but i really liked travel when i was a teenager... i was way wild than my parents expected and even covid didnt stop me hahahaha</li>
   <li>skinny, i really need a skinny body. my goal is 120ibs, but im 144ibs..lowest143ibs,.. im 5'8'' in my sneakers but as a apple-shaped person, i look too strong...my mom called me security guard bc im too fat in asian standard. </li>
   <li>moneymoneymoney... i didnt like luxious things before, but when i get older,i feel more fragile.. i feel so done with boston orange/green line, but i have no choice. when i went back in china this summer, jesus christ, land rover is so good...i thought i didnt care abt materilistic life...but when i compare my cheap clothes with burberry coat, when i struggled at a economy seat for 15 hours, i realized how imporatnt materilistic life is for an adult bc it's too exhuasting</li>
   <li>books.... i have hundreds of books at home while both my parents didnt even finish high school. i really like reading since very little. i liked history, philosophy and ancient poems before. i was so curious about unsolved mystries before. when i get older, i dont read any more bc i have to think about how to make a living by myself </li>
   <li>spanish, i didnt like spanish the first year i was learning it. i didnt give it up mainly bc my spanish teacher looked soo guapa and caring. i thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world hahaha, im not lesbian but i just like all the beauties. later i used spanish a lot for exploring my curiosities such as mayan culture, or music, or simpler, order the right food in a restaurant lmao</li>
    <li>beautiful; i never thought this is important, i thought it is just appearance, but i need soul-level communcation. my mom is a photographer, so i was growing up in a photo studio. i can do make up and use adobe photoshop well in 1st grade. but honestly i dont know why people around me always say i must look like my dad bc my mom looks too good. i felt so hurt when i was little, bc it makes me feel myself ugly. so i always pretended i dont care abt beautiful or not. it is useless. but when i get older.. i think looking good can make me feel happy. well no one wants to see an ugly person..being beautiful is a respect to life//</li>
